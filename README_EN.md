# Reaper Scripts

These are my Lua scripts for Reaper, written primarily for myself.

[Русская версия](README.md)

## Dependencies

Some scripts have the following dependencies:

- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- [faster-whisper-xxl](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

Before using, make sure they are installed and added to the `PATH` variable.

## About the scripts

Most, if not all, of the scripts are written using AI, as I am better at writing CMD scripts. You are welcome to fix, improve, and extend the functionality of these scripts.

## How to add to `PATH`

If you don't know how to add programs to the `PATH` variable, here is a tutorial:

## I hope you find my scripts useful!

P.S. Once I figure it out, I will add a link for importing scripts via [ReaPack](https://reapack.com/).
